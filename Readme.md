# Digi:[S]NES

This project was created to allow playing games on the PC using original SNES controllers. It is based on a Digispark board but can also run on clone boards. The code uses the Digispark Joystick library and some glue code to shift in the data from the controller and maps the directional controllers to X and Y axes and the remaining switches to ordinary buttons. It will work on NES gamepads as well.
